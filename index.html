				<span style="color:#00ff00;"><u><strong>Histology</strong></u></span></p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<strong><span style="color:#b22222;">    Histology  is the study of the microanatomy of cells, tissues, and organs as seen through a microscope. It examines the correlation between structure and function. </span></strong></p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<strong><span style="color:#b22222;">    This Histology Guide teaches the visual art of recognizing the structure of cells and tissues and understanding how this is determined by their function. </span></strong></p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<strong><span style="color:#b22222;">    Rather than reproducing the information found in a histology textbook, a user is shown how to apply this knowledge to interpret cells and tissues as viewed through a microscope. </span></strong></p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<strong><span style="color:#b22222;">    Because of the high cost of purchasing (and maintaining) microscopes and preparing (or purchasing) slide collections, histology is often taught today without laboratories. </span></strong></p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<strong><span style="color:#b22222;">    A histology atlas is frequently used as a replacement. This is unfortunate because no matter how good the few images in a textbook or histology atlas are, they cannot replace the experience of viewing a specimen through a microscope and that is why we took the pains of making this live section available because not everyone can have access to a microscope but with this you are covered.</span></strong></p>
